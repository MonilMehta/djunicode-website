We want everyone to have enough resources and mentors, in order for them to grow and get amazing internships and jobs in the industry. I strongly believe we would be producing enough students, armed with a variety of relevant skills, capable of competing with students from the country's top engineering colleges."

It has been the first concrete step in implementing an amalgam of ideas to address shortfalls in the engineering system arising from massive scale and the shortage of work opportunities. We've met some amazing kids who have grown into wonderful mentors and I hope to see the trend continue!"

This mentorship program would serve as the one stop shop for all CS related guidance on topics ranging from academia to the industry."

It's essential that students possess good networking skills and this was a platform for them to begin with. The long term goal was to get them ready to work in the industry by providing them with structured mentorship and technical experience through projects."
